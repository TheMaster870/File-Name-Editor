# File-Name-Editor
A little python script to batch change all file names in the the folder, Remove char, replace char or remove string.

This script just edits the files within the folder the script is located.

Just run the python script, choose:
1. Char Remove - removes a given char from the file names
2. Char Replace - replaces a given char with another
3. String remove - same as 1, but for strings.

It will then display the files found, what change it is making and then the new file names after the change.

This script was made to make changing downloaded video file names in bulk simpler but you can use it for whatever you want.
