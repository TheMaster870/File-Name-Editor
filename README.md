# File Name Editor
A little python script to batch change all file names in the the folder, Remove char, replace char or remove string.

This script just edits the files within the folder the script is located.

Just run the python script, choose:
1. Char Remove - removes a given char from the file names
2. Char Replace - replaces a given char with another
3. String remove - same as 1, but for strings.
4. Add to Start - Add a string to the start of each file name
5. Add to End - Add a string to the end of each file name
6. Remove from Start - Removes x number for chars from the start of the file name
7. Remove from End - Removes x number of chars from the end of the file name

It will then display the files found, what change it is making, ask you to verify and then the new file names after the change.
